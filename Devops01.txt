How is Kubernetes related to Docker?
Ans: A fundamental difference between Kubernetes and Docker is that Kubernetes is meant to run across a cluster while Docker runs on a single node. Kubernetes is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner.

What is Container Orchestration?

Ans: Container orchestration is the automation of much of the operational effort required to run containerized workloads and services. This includes a wide range of things software teams need to manage a container's lifecycle, including provisioning, deployment, scaling (up and down), networking, load balancing and more.

What are the features of Kubernetes?
Ans:  • Automated Scheduling.
 • Self-Healing Capabilities.
 • Automated rollouts & rollback.
 • Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing.
 • Offers environment consistency for development, testing, and production.
 • Infrastructure is loosely coupled to each component can act as a separate unit.

How does Kubernetes simplify containerized Deployment?
Ans: By abstracting the underlying infrastructure, Kubernetes allows you to run containers the same way on-prem as in the cloud. Through their Kubernetes services, these cloud providers manage the master node for you straight out of the box. Enterprises do not have to provision or manage the master node.

What is Google Container Engine?
Ans: Google Container Engine (GKE) is a management and orchestration system for Docker container and container clusters that run within Google's public cloud services. Google Container Engine is based on Kubernetes, Google's open source container management system
