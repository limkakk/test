study point: backgroud of docker run and pull cmd



there 2 commands: 

1: docker run -dit images name  /bin/bash >>> it will start the container but it will not enter into container
2: docker container -dti iamges name /bin/bash >>> it will start and enter into container, also if you excited from container, the container will be stopped 

Conculation: running both the command you will get to know that docker ran cmd will not excited the container but docker container cmd will exicted the container once you logout form the container.


Study point: diffecnce btw: 1 & 2 cmd
